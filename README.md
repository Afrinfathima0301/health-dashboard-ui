## 🎯 Project Background

This health dashboard UI was developed as part of a **frontend assessment task** to showcase design replication and component-based development using React.

The main objective was to:
- Recreate a high-fidelity UI based on a given reference design
- Build a fully responsive, modular layout using React and CSS
- Demonstrate attention to design detail, structure, and code quality

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is intended for **learning and portfolio demonstration purposes only**. The layout and visual structure were recreated from a reference — no original design claims or commercial usage intended.
